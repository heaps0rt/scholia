# Scholia

Scholia keeps your reading beside a tutor conversation. Open a PDF, select a
passage or figure, and ask a question with the source still in view. Organize
readings into workspaces or connect Canvas to browse courses and assignments.

There are three clients:

- **macOS:** a native SwiftUI and AppKit workspace with PDFKit, local OCR,
  document editing, practice and review, and a menu-bar companion for questions
  from other apps. Files and credentials stay on your Mac.
- **Web:** the same reading interface, backed either by the Mac app's optional
  loopback server or by an independent hosted service. Hosted accounts have
  private workspaces, their own Canvas connection, and their own provider keys.
- **Chrome extension:** explain selected text, mathematics, pages, and PDFs in
  a popup, side panel, or full-tab conversation. Its history stays in extension
  storage.

These libraries are separate. The Mac app and its local website share data;
there is no automatic sync with a hosted account or the extension.

## Get started

Use Node.js 24 or newer (`.nvmrc`), then install dependencies:

```sh
npm ci
```

### macOS

Requires macOS 14 or newer and Apple's developer tools.

```sh
npm run build:macos
npm run install:macos -- --launch
```

Choose a provider in Settings and test a model. Create a workspace, import a
file, or connect Canvas. See the [Mac setup guide](apps/macos/README.md) for
signing and permissions and the [workspace guide](docs/STUDY_WORKSPACE.md) for
reading, assignments, and course downloads.

### Hosted web

```sh
npm run build:web
npm run web:user -- --email you@example.com
npm run start:web
```

The account command reads a password from standard input. The development
service opens at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. For a separate server, use HTTPS and
persistent storage; [hosting instructions](docs/HOSTING.md) include Docker,
account administration, backups, and deployment limits.

### Chrome extension

```sh
npm run build
```

Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**,
and select `dist/chrome`. Configure a provider in Scholia's settings. See the
[extension guide](apps/chrome/README.md) for shortcuts, PDF reading, site access,
and local provider bridges.

## Providers and privacy

The native app and extension support hosted providers, Ollama, custom compatible
endpoints, and local Codex, Claude Code, and opencode bridges. The hosted service
supports its configured cloud providers; local bridges remain on your Mac.
Provider requests include your question and bounded source context. Selected
text, page references, and supplied images remain visible in the conversation.

Scholia includes no analytics or telemetry. Native and extension requests go
directly to the selected provider. With hosted web, files, conversations, and
credentials are stored on the server you use; that server sends provider
requests on your behalf. Its operator can access stored data. See the
[privacy policy](docs/PRIVACY.md) for storage, permissions, and retention.

## Development

```sh
npm run check           # JavaScript tests, syntax checks, and Swift parsing
npm run build:web       # website assets in dist/web
npm run build           # extension in dist/chrome
npm run check:dist      # validate the extension package
npm run package:chrome  # Web Store ZIP
npm run smoke:macos:workspace -- --data-only
node scripts/smoke-hosted-web.mjs
```

Browser verification uses Chromium. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for component boundaries, [practice and review](docs/PRACTICE.md) for the native
learning model, and [Chrome release instructions](docs/CHROME_WEB_STORE.md) for
packaging. Generated output belongs in ignored build directories.
